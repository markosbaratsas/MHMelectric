# Testing MHMelectric system

## Backend testing
In order to validate that the API is working as expected, Django testing was used.

Django tests were created for each of the 2 django apps (rest_api, users) and, specifically, 2 different kind of tests for each app (test views and test urls).
To execute the backend tests, first you need to install the backend system (installation steps on directory backend/README.md), and, then you can run:
```
python3 manage.py test
```
