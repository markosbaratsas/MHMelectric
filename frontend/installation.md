# Setup Frontend on localhost

## Requirements
* Node >= 8.10 on your machine
* npm >= 5.6 on your machine

## Instructions
1. First start the backend (since the frontend consumes the backend's API). There is information on how to start the backend environment on the backend/installation.md file.

2. On a new terminal (different than the previous that runs the Django server), cd into the frontend/user_management/ directory, and install the npm package:
```
npm install 
```

3. Then, you can start the project, by running (into the frontend/user_management/ directory):
```
npm start
```
